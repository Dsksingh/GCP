# gcp-docs
Download Google Cloud Platform's docs in PDF format

### Requirements
This project uses PDFMerge which in turn uses [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) to merge the documents and as such it is a requirement in order for PDFMerge to work. It will work on any platform supported by [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/).
Starting from v1.0.0 a requirement of Node >= 4.0.0 is required as well. If you are stuck in the dark ages then `npm i pdf-merge@0.1.1` should still work.

### Installing PDFtk
#### Windows
Download and run the [Installer](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/).

#### Debian, Ubuntu
```
apt-get install pdftk
```
